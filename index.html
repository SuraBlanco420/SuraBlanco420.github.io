<p> Hi, my name is Sarah. </p>
<p>I currently use a push bike to deliver but I recently completed my CBT so will be changing to moped driving. I am here today because I would like to further my knowledge of coding to increase my confidence in my ability to create a website. I want these skills because I want to be able to create a website for an online shop I am building and be able to offer my services on a discount freelance basis to friends and family.</p>
<ul>
   <li>My favourite foods are pomegranates and mushrooms</li>
   <li>I currently deliver in Crystal Palace Park and Streatham/West Norwood</li>
   <li>I like to read, watch movies and try out new vegan food</li>
   </ul>
